# BOITATECH - Save the Sea

This is a basic project using **PORTUGOL** to encourage children to become interested in programming.  
The project takes place thanks to the **Extension Project** class.

In this program, the user can choose which marine animal they want to save — turtles, dolphins, or fish — and then select from several environmental actions that help preserve the life of these creatures. Some actions are more effective than others. The program simulates a period of time and, at the end, shows whether the set of measures adopted was enough to protect the chosen animal.  
The project makes use of variables, if statements, and loops.
